Realized I needed this at least as a one time thing to clean up some accidental messes so here's a script that can organize screenshots (and presets if you enabled the feature to save those) based on app name. It can be next to your reshade.ini, in the screenshots folder or actually anywhere if you give it the right path as an argument. It expects the default %AppName% %Date% %Time% name format and will break if it doesnt match that (and possibly with some appnames if they have weird characters). You can set it up as a post-save command just by supplying the link to it in reshade's GUI. It might cause a brief lag spike but theoretically shouldnt after first time use. I didn't put in any extra logic to handle immediate saves differently than an entire folder but it shouldn't matter. I compiled it to an exe to make it work as a post save command but the python script is in the repo if you want to make changes. I actually have the ability to launch python or batch scripts from reshade but I havent pull requested yet and need to squash other bugs in that build. I generally don't recommend a global instance of reshade although I'm working on an external app to manage that, this is just a short term quick and dirty solution but maybe you find it useful
