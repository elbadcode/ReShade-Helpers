# reshade.fxh
- includes the shader reference guide commented out
# optical flow
- lengthened vectors and inverted direction
- read a paper showing that inverted motion vectors could be used to mitigate VR sickness
- I do not experience VR sickness and didnt test this in a VR environment so I'm not really sure if it does anything but I was pretty excited about it for 5 minutes and I think it generally behaves as intended. Possibly could be further modified to actually be useful, probably no one including me will ever touch it (and again I cant test it myself bc no sickness)
# DH anime
- just tweaked the ranges on some UI settings to make it more useful and usable as I was usually typing the numbers manually to go outside the range
