these are mostly just other people's shaders with some fun little tweaks. replace the originals since you need dependencies 

# Before After
- use for graphics show case, just set it on a keybind and record. speed is not configurable but I think its a good speed already
# DH uber mask
- added like 5 additional masks lol you can use the depth only masks for layering effects like in a photo editor almost
- added an animated mask, it needs a bit more work or a lot of manual tweaking of settings but theoretically it can animate any effect by depth 

## Everything else is just the regular effect with animation forced in using uuniforms and a const multiplier. Most have some degreee of configuration added in the UI, generally bare minimum for my own usage but should be easy enough to understand. If you actually find a usecase please let me know! I can probably improve on it. If there's something you want that isnt currently available through the special uniforms I'll at least take a look
